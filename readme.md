SIO2 Watcher
===

Simple program to look for changes in SIO2's ranking. The ultimate goal is to save the moments
where my ranking is higher than that of my friends, and to plot changes of everyone's scores over time.

Names are semi-anonymized by trimming surnames to one letter, to keep everyone's privacy safe.

Because I right now have about one data point, the chart is rather boring, but I'll publish it somewhere in the future.
